The web app used Giphy API to retrieve ten gif images of Miyazaki movies, which names are displayed on the buttons generated by the app. When each button is clicked, the corresponding still (not animated) gifs are appened to the flex-box rows. When a user clicks on each gif, the source of the image is switched to the animated version of the gif. The "Add" button and the input field allows for a user to add another movie, and the newly added movie name will be added to the current list of Miyazaki movies.
