The web app uses Giphy API to retrieve ten gif images of Miyazaki movies, which names are displayed on the buttons generated by the app. When each button is clicked, the corresponding still (not animated) gifs are appended to the flex-box rows (see the image): 

<img src="assets/images/App_view.png">

When a user clicks on each gif, the source of the image is switched to the animated version of the gif. The "Add" button and the input field allow for a user to add another movie title, and the newly added movie will be added to the current list of Miyazaki movies.
